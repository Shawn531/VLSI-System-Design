## Lab 1 - 5 stage RISC-V CPU
RV32I-M with CSR instruction

## Lab 2 - CPU + AXI
Implementation of AXI bus

## Lab 3 - A system with CPU, SRAM, ROM, DRAM, Sensor and WDT
Build a system based on Lab2 and it supports ISR

## Lab4 - A multi-clock domain system with level 1 cache
Add two level 1 cache for CPU, and deal with CDC by aFIFO

## Final Project - A low bandwidth image compression system
Implement the JPEG compression EPU and embedded into the system
